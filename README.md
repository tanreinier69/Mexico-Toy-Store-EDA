# Mexico-Toy-Store-EDA
Code for SQL EDA using a fictitious dataset from Maven Analytics

The purpose of this SQL query is to give an on-site analysis of the dataset at hand and demonstrate ability to create queries and navigate through a database.
I used Mexico Toy Store sales as my dataset, which can be retrieved here: https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?search=mexico

PostgreSQL was used as the main query platform.
